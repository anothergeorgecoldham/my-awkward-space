# Building in Public

I've decided to start building my projects in public and sharing my progress along the way.

## The Benefits

Building in public has several advantages:
- **Accountability** - It keeps me motivated
- **Community** - I can connect with others on the same journey
- **Learning** - Teaching others helps solidify my own knowledge

## What I'm Building

Currently, I'm working on this blog and several side projects that I'll share more about soon.
